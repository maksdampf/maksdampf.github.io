# maksdampf.github.io

This is the user Website of product designer David Burkhardt, aka MaksDampf.

For the technical implementation, i used a template idea from Mary Lou of Codrops:
https://github.com/codrops/ImageGridEffects/
which itself is based on Masonry by Dave DeSandro:
https://github.com/desandro/masonry

Otherwise the content is supplied by me. I did all articles myself, including all photos which are either shot or at least owned by me. Some content, like the bench designs etc. are open source (FAL), but please understand that as all other contents are portraying me and thus, as is the rule for "Opinion Works" (see Richard Stallmans turn on that), not to be considered in the public domain.
