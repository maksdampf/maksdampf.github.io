Hi, I am David Burkhardt, a product designer based in Hamburg, Germany and this is my website.

For the technical implementation, i used a template idea from Mary Lou of Codrops:
https://github.com/codrops/ImageGridEffects/
which itself is based on Masonry by Dave DeSandro:
https://github.com/desandro/masonry

Otherwise the content is supplied by myself. Some content, like the bench design etc. are open source, but please understand that as the other contents are portraying me and thus, as is recommended for "Opinion Works" (read Richard Stallmans turn on that), not to be considered public domain.
