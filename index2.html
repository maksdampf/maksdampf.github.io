							<h3>Maya Server</h3>

							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							Maya is a Server designed for Protonet GmbH.
							Protonets approach to servers is all about accessability. The goal is 
							to enable anybody to run their server Infrastructure from within their office, 
							without needing an IT-Operator to manage it.
							This led to a different design approach compared to traditional server chassis.
							</p><p>
							The device is cooled passively, without fans. Its Interface consists
							only of one button that is surrounded by one status light that can express
							exceptions, such as updating, backup, rebooting, errors,
							as colored light animations.
							</p><p>As an all-metal design, manufacturing scales from craftsman level
							production methods such as cnc-lasercutting and hand-welding for
							 some ten to hundred devices. More efficient cnc-stamping and robot-welding 
							 are used when a a few hundred are produced.
							 </p><p>Engineering and production ramp has been done by the designer himself.
							  This made it
							 possible to introduce manufacturing tweaks and improve processes, in an
							 iterative fashion, without consulting of other parties. 
							 Through these iterations it was possible over time to reduce manufacturing effort
							 by 50% while at the same time improving quality and lead time.

							<h3>Protonet Corporate Identity</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>When joining the Protonet project as a hardware designer
							there was not much of a corporate identity.
							Thus, a focus of hardware design was to create a recognition value from
							 scratch by using distinct color schemes
							and recurring shapes of Hexagons and Meshes.
							</p><p>

							The Carla server launched in 2012 and the later Maya product, formed Protonets design language.
						</p><p>
						 Guided by this design language, graphic design agency
						 npire created a complete set of matching screen and print design rules to create
						 the branding Protonet is known for.

							<h3>Patent DE 102013010867 B4</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							To create a noiseless Server, a fanless cooling method had to be invented. Crucial to
							the technology involved was paying special
							attention to the operating temperature range of each individual component.
							</p><p>
							Heat from the processor, is dissipated in a Heatsink on top of the chassis.
							This generates an airflow by induced convection, that sucks in cold air from
							between the harddisks. These Harddisks have the lowest temperature range and are thus
							 positioned at the bottom of the chassis in the cooler intake airflow.
							</p><p>
							This working principle was benchtested against conventional cooling methods. 
							The Patent was filed in 2013 and granted by DPMA in 08/2016.

							<h3>Carla 2 Server</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt & Tillmann Radmer</em>
							This Server was designed for Protonet as a successor to their popular Carla
							Server of 2013.
							</p>
							<p>
							It is not merely an update to the product line, but a complete technical redesign.
							All components are modular and can be slided out of the chassis individually.
							A new requirement for increased reliability and independence in case of a power outage
							or network breakdown, asked for additional plug-in modules.
							</p>
							<p>
							Like all Protonet products, Carla 2 is a design for accessability. It features only one button
							and will quietly fit on an office desk unlike a rackmount server.
							Its passive heatpipe cooling has been designed to fit newer, more powerful Hardware:
							8 core, 16 thread Xeon processor, 128Gb of RAM and 50Terabyte of Harddisk-Storage.
							Modules for an integrated uninterruptable power supply and a fallback internet
							connection (LTE modem), can be integrated.

							<h3>Process Engineering</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							One challenge when designing for a startup company is to
							cope with changing pace in development and manufacturing.
							What started as a test batch, had to be quickly ramped up to
							 several thousand devices. 
							Enabling this evolution, several
							new processes were developed. Processes consist of setting up 
							ad-hoc or permanent
							 production lines, creating instruction books,
							efficient onboarding standards for part-timers,
							 or the design of additional tooling or software.
							</p>
							<p>Product design can play a 
							mayor role in accelerating the production ramp 
							and assuring quality. 
							For example the use of rugged transport cases for 
							subcontractor logistics not only sped up
							the process, but resulted in no more
							sub standard
							parts from damage by handling. It also led to an almost hundred percent decrease
							 in packaging
							waste during manufacturing logistics.

							<h3>Spring scissors</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							A local scissors manufacturer wanted to launch a new retail brand for scissors.
							As a original manufacturer, the client already produced scissors for several well known retail brands,
							but wanted to have a retail marque on their own.
							The client asked Prof. Glen Oliver Loew of the HfbK, 
							who created a student team to come up
							with design ideas that have recognition value.
							</p>
							<p>
							Spring scissors are not new, in fact they are some of the earliest examples of scissors 
							in human history. But since then the concept of a spring scissor, which 
							stays open by itself and closes when pressed, has been reduced to a few niche applications
							 like
							sheep-shearing.</p>
							<p>Not rightly so: Despite weaknesses like less cutting thickness capability, 
							scissor shears also have unique strengths. Having no link at the end of the blades,
							it is easier to cut along curved shapes.</p>
							<p>
							The design got acknowledgement from the client, but due to unknown processes and materials,
							was not chosen for manufacturing.

							In its free time it likes to cook. With the help from the people at the
