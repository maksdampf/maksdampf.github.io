							<h3>Maya Server</h3>

							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							Maya is a Server designed for Protonet GmbH by David Burkhardt.
							Protonet's approach to servers focuses on accessability. The goal is
							to enable anybody to run their server Infrastructure from within their office,
							without needing an IT-Operator to manage it.
							This led to a different design approach compared to traditional rack server chassis.
							</p><p>
							The device is cooled passively, without fans. Its interface consists
							only of one button that is surrounded by one status light that can express
							exceptions, such as updating, backup, rebooting, errors,
							via colored light animations.
							</p><p>As an all-metal design, small lots of a few hundred devices can
							be manufactured with craftsman level
							production methods such as cnc-lasercutting and hand-welding.
							More economical cnc-stamping and robot-welding
							 are used for higher lot sizes of a few thousand.
							 </p><p>This was not merely a design project, as Engineering and production ramp
							 have also been implemented by David Burkhardt.
							  This made it
							 possible to introduce manufacturing tweaks and improve processes into the design.
							 Development was done in an
							 iterative fashion, without the necessity of consulting of other parties between the
							 designer and contract manufacturers.

							 Through these iterations it was possible  to reduce manufacturing effort
							 by over 50% during the design phase,
							 while at the same time improving quality and lead time over the first generation
							 design.

							<h3>Protonet Corporate Identity</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>When joining the Protonet Project as a hardware designer,
							the project did not have a corporate identity.
							Thus, one focus of hardware design was to create a recognition value and a
							form language from scratch.
							<i>
							This was implemented by using a distinct color scheme
							and recurring shapes of Hexagons and Meshes.</i>
							</p><p>

							David Burkhardt joined the Protonet Project in 2009.
							The Company was launched in 2012 along with its first Product,
							the Carla server. The Carla server and the Maya product of 2014,
							formed Protonets design language.
						</p><p>
						 Guided by this design language, graphic design agency
						 npire created a complete set of matching screen and print design rules to create
						 the branding Protonet is known for.

							<h3>Patent DE 102013010867 B4</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							A fanless cooling method was invented by David Burkhardt for a noiseless
							 server design for Protonet GmbH.
							The method is based on the operating temperature range of each individual components
							and positioning these components according to it inside the chassis.
							</p><p>
							Heat from the processor, dissipates in a heatsink on top of the chassis.
							This generates an airflow by induced convection, that sucks in cold air from
							between the harddisks. These harddisks have the lowest temperature range and are thus
							 positioned at the bottom of the chassis in the cooler intake airflow.
							</p><p>
							This working principle was benchtested against conventional cooling methods.
							The Patent was filed in 2013 and granted by DPMA in 08/2016.

							<h3>Carla 2 Server</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt & Tillmann Radmer</em>
							This Server was designed for Protonet as a successor to their Carla
							Server of 2013.
							</p>
							<p>
							It is not merely an update to the product line, but a complete technical redesign.
							All components are modular and can be slid out of the chassis individually.
							Reliability and independence in case of a power outage
							or network breakdown required additional plug-in modules.
							</p>
							<p>
							Like the other products developed for Protonet, Carla 2 has been designed for accessability.
							It has only one button
							and unlike a rackmount Server it will quietly fit on an office desk.
							Its passive heatpipe cooling has been designed to fit newer, more powerful Hardware:
							8 core, 16 thread Xeon processor, 128Gb of RAM and 50Terabyte of Harddisk-Storage.
							Modules for an integrated uninterruptable power supply and a fallback internet
							connection (LTE modem), can be integrated.

							<h3>Process Engineering</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							When designing for a startup company like Protonet, one challenge is to
							cope with a changing pace in development and manufacturing.
							What started as a test batch, had to be ramped up quickly to
							 several thousand devices.
							To make this evolution possible, several
							new processes were developed by David Burkhardt for Protonet GmbH:
							Setting up ad-hoc or permanent
							 production lines, designing additional tooling and software
							 as well as creating instruction books and onboarding guides.
							</p>
							<p>
							For example the design of rugged transport cases for parts supplied by
							subcontractors not only sped up
							the logistics process, but resulted in elimination of
							any damage caused by handling.
							It also led to an almost hundred percent decrease
							 in packaging
							waste during manufacturing logistics.

							The design is inspired by <i>Will Holman's Scrap Table (Guerilla furniture)</i>,
							 but uses other proportions and simplified materials:
							 generic 4x6 roof lath and 2x10 cm board.
							</p>
							<p>
							The tapered legs are stressed to give necessary stiffness to the thin board.
							Contrary to Holmans design, the legs are not interconnected by threaded rods.
							Non-triangulated beams do not add much stability to the space frame, so they were left out.
							The design has been donated to public domain by David Burkhardt under the Free Art License.

							<h3>Spring Scissors</h3>
							<p><em>David Burkhardt</em>
							In 2007, a local scissors manufacturer wanted to launch a new retail brand for scissors.
							As an original manufacturer, the client already produced scissors for several well-known retail brands,
							but wanted to have a retail marque of their own.
							The client asked Prof. Glen Oliver Loew of the HfbK,
							to create a student team to come up
							with design ideas that would have recognition value.
							</p>
							<p>
							Spring scissors are not new, in fact, they are some of the earliest examples of scissors
							in human history. But since then, the concept of a spring scissor, which
							stays open by itself and closes when pressed, has been reduced to a few niche applications
							 like
							sheep-shearing.</p>
							<p>Not rightly so: Scissor shears have unique strengths. It is easier to cut along curved shapes,
							since there is no link at the end of the blades.
